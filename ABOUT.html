<h1>About Us</h1>
<p style="font-size:150%;">

<b>D'Kicks速</b> is an online seller of shoes based in Las Pi単as City, Philippines.<br>
It was started by a college student who is tasked in one of his major subjects<br>
to create a website with a set of options from an E-commerce website, to an Educational website.<br><br>

He chose to create an E-commerce website because he thinks it will be easy other than an<br>
educational website because it will take time to research.<br>
<br>
<b>D'Kicks速</b> wants to share a unique sneaker culture and lifestyle to all Filipinos and the rest of the world.<br>
<b>D'Kicks速</b> only sell 100% authentic/legit products or your money back.<br>
All of our products are in brand new/deadstock condition unless otherwise stated in the product description.<br>
In the case of older kicks, do wear at your own risk as there is a big possibility that they will easily wear out.
